# Notes about cancer datasets
There are multiple cancer datasets and accessing them can be sometime daunting. Here we are providing some useful information that may help you better navigate the platforms.  

## The Cancer Genome Atlas [(TCGA)](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga)
Clinical, biospecimen, molecular characterization, and imaging data for samples from 11,000 patients (USA) spanning [33 cancer types](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga/studied-cancers). Including Breast Cancer (TCGA-BRCA) with 1000+ patients
+ [GDC data portal](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/): By filtering and selecting different options it is possible to download many different data types

## The Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes [(PCAWG)](https://dcc.icgc.org/pcawg)
 International collaboration to identify common patterns of mutation in more than 2,600 cancer whole genomes from the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC). This dataset includes the data from TCGA
